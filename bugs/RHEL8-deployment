I am trying to build from scratch on Redhat Enterprise 8.

After configure was successful, the make gave the following error

checking that generated files are newer than configure... done
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
gawk: symbol lookup error: /root/M2/M2/usr-host/lib/libreadline.so.8: undefined symbol: UP
config.status: error: could not create Makefile
make[2]: *** [../Makefile.library:181: .configured-4.2.1] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory '/root/M2/M2/libraries/factory'
make[1]: *** [Makefile:7: all-in-factory] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/root/M2/M2/libraries'
make: *** [GNUmakefile:251: all-in-libraries] Error 2



I read somewhere that libreadline needs libtinfo for the undefined symbol UP.
How do I fix the configure?

Thanks
